## Usage

- go to https://manganelo.com/bookmark or https://mangakakalot.com/bookmark
- go to Dev Tools -> Console
- paste the script to console (or just drag and drop), and press enter!

after that, it will create a text file of your bookmark list and the same list will be shown on the console

## Notes
a modified version of [this](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/390432-mananelo-mangakakalot-bookmarks-export/code) script 

idk if this works on other browsers besides from chrome. lol
